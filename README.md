# FreshRSS Pocket Button

A [FreshRSS](https://freshrss.org/) extension which adds a better [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) sharing integration.

The existing Pocket sharing functionality of FreshRSS always opens a new tab which you have to manually close after sharing. You also have to stay logged in into Pocket.

With this extension you can simply press the Pocket Button next to an article or a custom keyboard shortcut to share it with Pocket. Everything else happens in the background while you can continue reading articles without any further interruptions.
